Proggy-Buggy Contest
DataArt invites you to participate in the international informal programming The Proggy-Buggy Contest 2023.

This contest has been running since 2014 and has drawn participants worldwide (more than 10,000 people from 60 countries over nine years).

The contest’s goal is to solve up to 13 algorithmic problems within a 42-minute time limit. The main heroes of each problem are Proggy and Buggy. Proggy is a highly skilled and creative creature who writes programs, while Buggy can sometimes cause delays with errors that Proggy must work through. It can be challenging to navigate these obstacles, but with patience and understanding, Proggy always finds a solution.

To solve any problem, create a console application and select a programming language from the drop-down list (C, C++, Free Pascal, Java, Mono C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript). Once you've written your code, send the source text to the verification server for review. Remember that not all problems have a solution, and particular tasks may require a specific method.

We have different categories for experienced competitors and beginners. The competition is open to everyone, whether you're a solo participant or part of a team of up to three people. While you don't need to be a programming expert to join, having some knowledge and skills in some programming language can give you an edge.

Why is it informal?
What is up with the concept of 42 minutes? It comes from a book by Douglas Adams where the answer to the "Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything" was thought to hold the key to solving all the problems in the universe. It's pretty cool. After seven million years of continuous calculations on a unique computer called Deep Thought, they discovered the answer was "42". We were inspired by this idea for our competition.

When and where?
On December 9th, 2023, we organize the annual International Programming Proggy-Buggy Contest. The Contest will be online, but you or your team can visit our DataArt offices in different countries and solve problems with other participants.

How is the competition designed?
team
Individual participation
You can participate individually or with a team (up to 3 participants).

laptop
One computer
The participant or a team can use only one device from which the solutions will be sent to the server for verification.

check
Automatic answer scoring
The Standings will become available after the official announcement of the results, as answers are automatically scored on the dedicated server.

lang
Many languages
The solution code can be written in one of many languages, and a complete list is given on the server.

Participation rules:
Main rules for all participants:

All participants will be granted access to the problems of the Proggy-Buggy Contest 2023.
All participants will have 13 problems and 42 minutes for completion. Problems will be available officially on December 9th. We start the final countdown on the stream. Be ready and join us.
The problems will be in English. During the contest, all communications will be in English.
The code for your solutions can be written in one of many languages. A complete list is provided on the server.
Individual participants will need:

notebook
stable network connection.
For teams:

The maximum number of participants in a team is three people.
The team can use only one device from which the solutions will be sent to the server for verification.
If a team is unable to gather in one room, it is permitted to use instant messengers (Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram, Skype, etc.) solely for communication between participants.
PARTICIPATE
Who can take part?
We invite students, developers, testers, and all passionate people with an understanding of how programs are written, what "console applications" and "standard input/output streams" are, and everyone who likes to solve unsolved problems.

You can participate individually or with a team (up to 3 participants). The Contest will be online, but you or your team can visit our DataArt offices in different countries and solve problems with other participants.

Registration is "free": provide your email, to which you'll get a link that you can use to complete registration.

Participants residing on the territory of the Russian Federation, as well as from other sanctioned territories, are not allowed to take part in the Proggy-Buggy Contest 2023.

Who is the winner?
The winner will be the individual participant or the team who solves the maximum number of tasks with the lowest penalty.

The penalty is the “total time” used to solve a task, which is determined in the following way: the total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem. No time is consumed for a problem that is not solved (https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules).

Traditionally, we determine the winners in the following categories:

Honorary 1st place (Team or Individual Participant)
Honorary 2nd place (Team or Individual Participant)
Honorary 3rd place (Team or Individual Participant).
In addition, we have added extra categories:

Prize for the very first correct solution to the problem.
Prize for the shortest answer to a problem that has a solution.
Prize for the first correct answer to a problem with no solution.
Honorable Mention for the team or participant with the most penalty points.
Honorable Mention for the team or participant with the least penalty points.
The contest will have three types of participants:

Amateurs (participants over the age of 16 who attend school or other secondary education institutions, as well as students of higher education institutions, and those who have participated in university, city, regional, or national-level Olympiads (excluding ACM ICPC International Programming Contests or School Olympiad in the programming of any level)).
Professionals (participants with previous experience in the National Student (ACM ICPC) or School (IOI) Olympiad in programming or other programming competitions).
Superheroes (participants who ranked in the top 10 of the National Student Olympiad (ACM ICPC) or School Olympiad (IOI) in programming, as well as past winners of the Proggy-Buggy Contest in all categories).
Participation is free of charge, but you would need to register. So, go ahead and give it a shot!
