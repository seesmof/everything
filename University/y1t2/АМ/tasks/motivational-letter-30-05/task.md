Dear Professor Tabunshchyk and Ms. Duiko,

I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the credit mobility program under the EU Erasmus+ Program. It would be an honor for me to be a part of the cooperation between NUZP and KU Leuven.

I am a software engineering first year student at NUZP and I am eager to broaden my horizons by studying at KU Leuven. I am particularly drawn to the program's focus on mutual exchange of students, teachers, and administrative staff, as it provides a unique opportunity to interact with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures.

I have always been passionate about web development, and pretty much any programming related topics, and I believe that studying at KU Leuven will allow me to further my knowledge in this field. I am confident that the courses offered at the De Nayer campus will challenge me academically and intellectually, and I am excited to be part of a community of scholars who share my interests.

In addition to my academic interests, I am also excited to experience the cultural richness of Leuven and to explore the city's historical landmarks and vibrant student life. I am confident that this experience will not only broaden my academic horizons but also allow me to develop my personal and social skills.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to participate in the credit mobility program and look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
Onyshchenko Oleh
