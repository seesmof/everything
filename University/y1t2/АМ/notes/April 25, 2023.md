- oh, man, this is way not what i was expecting. we have a table where we have to assess the presentation of others and the first one who was presenting was Milena. she did a good job, but mispronounced one word or a couplea, but i think that we can pretty much expect from everybody to mispronounce something, as we are not native speakers. but this takes so much time. right now is 10:50, around 30 minutes goes to one presentation and feedback, thats crazy. I have to take the initiative and present right after everybody finished with their feedback, otherwise id have present the next class which i dont want so badly. alright, now were just waiting for everybody to finish
- okay, so i joined a breakout room and were discussing the Milena’s presentation and we can all pretty much agree on the pretty decent job she did but the enthusiasm wasn’t quite there, plus the content was not as clear, plus the questions the teacher asked her were not completely answered, so Maxim gave her 89 and I gave her 97. i dont know, man, i feel like im just afraid to critisise people
- natural reader is worth checking out
