When comparing the two resumes, it is clear that Sample 2 is more suitable for applying for a job.

Here are the reasons why:

- Sample 1 contains a vague objective and a summary that is not relevant to any specific job. In contrast, Sample 2 provides a clear objective and a summary that is tailored to specific job requirements.
- Sample 2 includes relevant education and qualifications, whereas Sample 1 only lists a high school diploma.
- Sample 2 has work experience that is directly related to the field of business, while Sample 1 has limited work experience that is not related to any particular field.
- Sample 2 has additional qualifications and skills that are relevant to the job, such as the Advanced Certificate in MS Word, MS Excel, and MS Access, while Sample 1 only lists hobbies.

Therefore, based on the above points, Sample 2 is more suitable when applying for a job. It contains relevant information that is tailored to the job requirements, and provides a clear picture of the candidate's qualifications and experience.
