You have given a valid example of the use of LP, but your mathematical model is incomplete and incorrect. Let me explain why and how to improve it.

- Your objective function is not clear. What does $F$ represent? How do you measure the pleasure of the picnic? You should define a clear and quantifiable objective function that reflects your goal. For example, you could assume that each guest has a preference for food and drinks, and that the total pleasure is the sum of the individual pleasures. Then, you could write something like:

$$
\displaystyle
F = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i \cdot food + b_i \cdot drinks) \rightarrow max \\
$$

Where $n$ is the number of guests, $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the preferences of the $i$-th guest for food and drinks, respectively, and $food$ and $drinks$ are the total amounts of food and drinks purchased.

- Your constraints are not consistent. You have introduced a variable $vegetarian$ that is not defined. What does it mean? Is it the number of vegetarians among the guests? Is it the amount of vegetarian food available? You should define your variables clearly and use them consistently. For example, if you want to ensure that there is enough vegetarian food for the vegetarians, you could write something like:

$$
\displaystyle
v \cdot food \ge m \\
$$

Where $v$ is the fraction of vegetarian food in the total food, and $m$ is the minimum amount of vegetarian food required.

- Your constraints are not complete. You have not considered the availability of food and drinks, or the nutritional requirements of the guests. You should include these constraints to make your problem more realistic and feasible. For example, you could write something like:

$$
\displaystyle
food \le f \\
drinks \le d \\
c \cdot food + d \cdot drinks \ge n \cdot r \\
$$

Where $f$ and $d$ are the maximum amounts of food and drinks available, $c$ and $d$ are the calories per unit of food and drinks, respectively, and $r$ is the minimum calorie intake per guest.

- Your constraints are not linear. You have used a logical expression (logically, there will be much less food than drinks) that is not a linear function. You should replace it with a linear inequality that captures the same idea. For example, you could write something like:

$$
\displaystyle
food \le k \cdot drinks \\
$$

Where $k$ is a constant that represents the ratio of food to drinks.

To summarize, your mathematical model should look something like this:

$$
\displaystyle
F = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i \cdot food + b_i \cdot drinks) \rightarrow max \\
$$
