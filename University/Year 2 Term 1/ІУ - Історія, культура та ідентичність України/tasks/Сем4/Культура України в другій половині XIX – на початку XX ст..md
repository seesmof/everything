The second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century was a period of significant cultural and social change in Ukraine. During this time, Ukraine experienced a national revival that was characterized by a renewed interest in Ukrainian language, literature, and culture. This revival was driven by a desire to assert Ukrainian identity and to resist the cultural and political domination of Russia.

One of the most important cultural movements of this period was the Ukrainian National Revival, which began in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This movement was characterized by a renewed interest in Ukrainian language, literature, and culture. The first wave of national revival is traditionally connected with the publication of the first part of "Eneyida" by Ivan Kotlyarevsky in 1798 ². The second wave of national revival began in the second half of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. This period saw a flowering of Ukrainian literature, music, and art.

The cultural revival of Ukraine during this period was closely linked to political developments. In the late 19th century, Ukrainians began to demand greater autonomy from Russia. This led to a series of cultural and educational reforms that aimed to promote Ukrainian language and culture. In 1863, for example, Ukrainian was officially recognized as a language of instruction in schools in Galicia ¹. In 1876, the Prosvita society was founded in Lviv with the aim of promoting Ukrainian culture and education ¹. The society established libraries, reading rooms, and schools throughout Galicia.

The cultural revival of Ukraine during this period was also characterized by a renewed interest in folk traditions. Folk songs, dances, and customs were collected and studied by scholars such as Mykhailo Drahomanov and Ivan Franko ². This interest in folk traditions helped to create a sense of national identity among Ukrainians.

The cultural revival of Ukraine during this period was not limited to literature and folk traditions. It also extended to music and art. The composer Mykola Lysenko played an important role in promoting Ukrainian music during this period. He collected folk songs and used them as inspiration for his own compositions ². The artist Ivan Trush played an important role in promoting Ukrainian art during this period. He founded an art school in Lviv that emphasized Ukrainian themes ².

In conclusion, the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century was a period of significant cultural revival in Ukraine. This revival was characterized by a renewed interest in Ukrainian language, literature, music, art, and folk traditions. The cultural revival was closely linked to political developments and helped to create a sense of national identity among Ukrainians.
