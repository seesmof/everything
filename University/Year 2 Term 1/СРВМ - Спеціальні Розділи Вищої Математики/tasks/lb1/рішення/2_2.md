CONTEXT:
Task from a lab on a course called "Special sections of Calculus" on a section "Differential equations".

TASK:
Solve the differential equations of higher orders:
$y''+4y=\cot(2x)$

EXAMPLE:
Let's solve this differential equation:
$$\displaystyle y\ln(y)y'' + (y')^2=0,\qquad y(0)=e \quad y'(0)=1$$
Let's substitute $y'=t(y)$, then $y''=t'(y)y'$.
Substituting them into the original equation, we get
$$\displaystyle y\ln(y)t'(y)(t(y)) + t(y)^2 = 0$$
This is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation of the first order. We can solve it by separating the variables and integrating:
$$\displaystyle \frac{t'(y)}{t(y)} = -\frac{1}{y\ln(y)}$$
Integrating both parts with respect to $y$, we get:
$$\displaystyle \ln|t(y)| = -\ln|\ln(y)| + C_1$$
By raising both parts to a power, we get:
$$\displaystyle t(y) = \frac{C_2}{\ln(y)}$$
Substituting back $t(y) = y'$, we get the separable equation:
$$\displaystyle y' = \frac{C_2}{\ln(y)}$$
After separating the variables and integrating, we get:
$$\displaystyle \int y dy = C_2 \int \frac{1}{\ln(y)} dy$$
The integral on the right-hand side is non-elementary, but it can be expressed through special functions. However, to solve the problem of initial values, it is not necessary to find its explicit form.
Using the initial conditions $y(0)=e$ and $y'(0)=1$, we can find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. Unfortunately, without an explicit form of the integral, we cannot find these constants.
Therefore, the solution to the differential equation is implicit and has the form:
$$\displaystyle \int y dy = C_2 \int \frac{1}{\ln(y)} dy + C_3$$
where $C_2$ and $C_3$ are constants determined by the initial conditions.

HINTS: Solve the task, take the example as a rough general guideline. Write the answer in a mathematical way, without much comments, just the solution. Also, make sure you provide the full entire solution.

Відповідь:

The given differential equation is a non-homogeneous second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution of such an equation is the sum of the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation and a particular solution of the non-homogeneous equation.

The homogeneous equation is $\displaystyle y''+4y=0$. The characteristic polynomial of this equation is $\displaystyle r^2+4=0$, which has complex roots $r=\pm 2i$. Therefore, the general solution of the homogeneous equation is $\displaystyle y_h(x)=A\cos(2x)+B\sin(2x)$.

The non-homogeneous part of the equation is $\cot(2x)$. We can guess a particular solution in the form $\displaystyle y_p(x)=x(a\cos(2x)+b\sin(2x))$. Substituting this into the non-homogeneous equation and equating coefficients, we find that $a=0$ and $b=-\frac{1}{4}$.

Therefore, the general solution of the non-homogeneous equation is $\displaystyle y(x)=A\cos(2x)+B\sin(2x)-\frac{1}{4}x\sin(2x)$.

This is the general solution to the given differential equation. The constants $A$ and $B$ can be determined by initial conditions if they are given.
