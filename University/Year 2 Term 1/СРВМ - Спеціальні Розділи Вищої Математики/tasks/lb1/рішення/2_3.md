CONTEXT:
Task from a lab on a course called "Special sections of Calculus" on a section "Differential equations".

TASK:
Solve the differential equations of higher orders:
$\displaystyle y''+2y'+5y=8.5\cos(2x)+40e^5x,\qquad y(0)=1\frac{7}{17} \quad y'(0)=8\frac{5}{17}$

EXAMPLE:
Let's solve this differential equation:
$$\displaystyle y\ln(y)y'' + (y')^2=0,\qquad y(0)=e \quad y'(0)=1$$
Let's substitute $y'=t(y)$, then $y''=t'(y)y'$.
Substituting them into the original equation, we get
$$\displaystyle y\ln(y)t'(y)(t(y)) + t(y)^2 = 0$$
This is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation of the first order. We can solve it by separating the variables and integrating:
$$\displaystyle \frac{t'(y)}{t(y)} = -\frac{1}{y\ln(y)}$$
Integrating both parts with respect to $y$, we get:
$$\displaystyle \ln|t(y)| = -\ln|\ln(y)| + C_1$$
By raising both parts to a power, we get:
$$\displaystyle t(y) = \frac{C_2}{\ln(y)}$$
Substituting back $t(y) = y'$, we get the separable equation:
$$\displaystyle y' = \frac{C_2}{\ln(y)}$$
After separating the variables and integrating, we get:
$$\displaystyle \int y dy = C_2 \int \frac{1}{\ln(y)} dy$$
The integral on the right-hand side is non-elementary, but it can be expressed through special functions. However, to solve the problem of initial values, it is not necessary to find its explicit form.
Using the initial conditions $y(0)=e$ and $y'(0)=1$, we can find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. Unfortunately, without an explicit form of the integral, we cannot find these constants.
Therefore, the solution to the differential equation is implicit and has the form:
$$\displaystyle \int y dy = C_2 \int \frac{1}{\ln(y)} dy + C_3$$
where $C_2$ and $C_3$ are constants determined by the initial conditions.

HINTS: Solve the task, take the example as a rough general guideline. Write the answer in a mathematical way, without much comments, just the solution. Also, make sure you provide the full entire solution.

Відповідь:

The given differential equation is a non-homogeneous second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution of such an equation is the sum of the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation and a particular solution of the non-homogeneous equation.

The homogeneous equation is $\displaystyle y''+2y'+5y=0$. The characteristic polynomial of this equation is $\displaystyle r^2+2r+5=0$, which has complex roots $r=-1\pm 2i$. Therefore, the general solution of the homogeneous equation is $\displaystyle y_h(x)=e^{-x}(A\cos(2x)+B\sin(2x))$.

The non-homogeneous part of the equation consists of two terms: $8.5\cos(2x)$ and $40e^{5x}$. We can find a particular solution for each term separately and then add them together.

For the term $8.5\cos(2x)$, we can guess a particular solution in the form $\displaystyle y_p(x)=a\cos(2x)+b\sin(2x)$. Substituting this into the non-homogeneous equation and equating coefficients, we find that $a=0$ and $b=-\frac{17}{10}$.

For the term $40e^{5x}$, we can guess a particular solution in the form $\displaystyle y_p(x)=ce^{5x}$. Substituting this into the non-homogeneous equation, we find that $c=\frac{8}{9}$.

Therefore, the general solution of the non-homogeneous equation is $\displaystyle y(x)=e^{-x}(A\cos(2x)+B\sin(2x))-\frac{17}{10}\sin(2x)+\frac{8}{9}e^{5x}$.

Using the initial conditions $y(0)=1\frac{7}{17}$ and $y'(0)=8\frac{5}{17}$, we can solve for $A$ and $B$. This gives us $A=1\frac{7}{17}$ and $B=8\frac{5}{17}+\frac{17}{10}+\frac{40}{9}$.

Therefore, the solution to the differential equation is:
$$y(x)=e^{-x}\left[\left(1\frac{7}{17}\right)\cos(2x)+\left(8\frac{5}{17}+\frac{17}{10}+\frac{40}{9}\right)\sin(2x)\right]-\frac{17}{10}\sin(2x)+\frac{8}{9}e^{5x}$$
