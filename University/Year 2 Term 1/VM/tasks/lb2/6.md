## Рішення

To calculate the integral $\int_{0}^{0.1} \frac{\ln{1+2x}}{x}dx$ with an error of up to 0.001, we can use the power series expansion of the natural logarithm function, which is given by:

$$\ln(1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4} + \cdots$$

Substituting $x$ with $2x$ in the above series, we get:

$$\ln(1+2x) = 2x - 2x^2 + \frac{4x^3}{3} - 2x^4 + \cdots$$

Now, we can divide this series by $x$ to get:

$$\frac{\ln(1+2x)}{x} = 2 - 2x + \frac{4x^2}{3} - 2x^3 + \cdots$$

This is a power series, and we can integrate it term by term to get:

$$\int_{0}^{0.1} \frac{\ln{1+2x}}{x}dx = \int_{0}^{0.1} (2 - 2x + \frac{4x^2}{3} - 2x^3 + \cdots) dx$$

$$= \left[2x - x^2 + \frac{4x^3}{9} - \frac{x^4}{2}\right]_{0}^{0.1} + \cdots$$

We can calculate this expression up to the term that gives an error less than 0.001. In this case, the first four terms should be enough, because the fifth term (which we are omitting) is $\frac{x^5}{5}$ evaluated at $x = 0.1$, which is less than 0.001.

So, the approximate value of the integral is:

$$\approx \left[2(0.1) - (0.1)^2 + \frac{4(0.1)^3}{9} - \frac{(0.1)^4}{2}\right] - \left[2(0) - (0)^2 + \frac{4(0)^3}{9} - \frac{(0)^4}{2}\right]$$

You can calculate this expression to get the numerical value of the integral.
