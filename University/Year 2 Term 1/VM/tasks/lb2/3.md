## Рішення

To expand the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}\cos{x}$ into a power series, we can use the power series expansions of the elementary functions involved, namely the square root function and the cosine function.

The power series expansion of the square root function around $x = a$ is given by:

$$\sqrt{x} = \sqrt{a} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{a}}(x-a) - \frac{1}{8a\sqrt{a}}(x-a)^2 + \cdots$$

And the power series expansion of the cosine function is:

$$\cos{x} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots$$

Now, we can multiply these two series together to get the power series expansion of the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}\cos{x}$. However, this will be a bit complicated because it involves multiplying two infinite series together.

We can simplify this by expanding the function around $x = 0$ (i.e., $a = 0$). In this case, the square root function becomes $\sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}$, which is already a power series (with all coefficients except for the $x^{1/2}$ term being zero).

So, we have:

$$f(x) = x^{1/2}(1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots)$$

This is the power series expansion of the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}\cos{x}$ around $x = 0$. Note that this series only converges for $-1 \leq x \leq 1$. For values of $x$ outside this interval, the series does not converge to $f(x)$.
