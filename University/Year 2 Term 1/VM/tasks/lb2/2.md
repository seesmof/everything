## Рішення

The series you've provided is an example of an alternating series. An alternating series is a series whose terms alternate in sign between positive and negative. There is a specific test, the Alternating Series Test, that we can use to determine whether this series converges.

The Alternating Series Test states that if the following two conditions are met, the series converges:

1. The terms $$b_n = \frac{1}{n+1}$$ decrease as $$n$$ increases. This means that each term is smaller than or equal to the previous term, i.e., $$b_{n+1} \leq b_n$$ for all $$n$$.
2. The limit as $$n$$ approaches infinity of $$b_n$$ is zero, i.e., $$\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n = 0$$.

Let's apply these conditions to our series:

1. Decreasing terms: We have $$b_{n+1} = \frac{1}{n+2}$$ and $$b_n = \frac{1}{n+1}$$. It's clear that $$b_{n+1} \leq b_n$$ for all $$n$$, so the first condition is met.
2. Limit to zero: We have $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n+1} = 0$$, so the second condition is also met.

Since both conditions of the Alternating Series Test are satisfied, we can conclude that the series $$\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}$$ converges.
