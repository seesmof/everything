Introduction

The New Economic Policy (NEP) was a temporary economic policy introduced by Lenin in 1921 to revive the Soviet economy after the devastation of the civil war and the war communism. The NEP allowed some degree of market relations and private enterprise, especially in agriculture and small-scale industry, while the state retained control over large-scale industry, banking and foreign trade. The NEP was seen as a compromise between the socialist ideals of the Bolsheviks and the realities of a backward and war-torn country. However, the NEP also faced many challenges and criticisms, both from within and outside the party, and was eventually replaced by Stalin's campaign of rapid industrialisation and collectivisation in the late 1920s. Stalin's policies aimed to transform the Soviet Union into a modern industrial power, capable of competing with the capitalist countries and defending itself from external threats. However, Stalin's policies also had devastating consequences for the people and the environment, especially in Ukraine, where millions of peasants were forced to join collective farms, deprived of their land and livestock, and subjected to famine, repression and terror.

Body paragraphs

The NEP was a response to the economic crisis that the Soviet Union faced in 1921, after four years of civil war and war communism. War communism was a policy of extreme centralisation and doctrinaire socialism that had, by 1921, brought the national economy to the point of total breakdown. The main features of war communism were: the nationalisation of all industry and trade; the abolition of private property; the requisitioning of surplus grain and other products from the peasants; the rationing of food and goods; the introduction of labour conscription; and the suppression of any opposition or dissent. War communism was justified by the Bolsheviks as a necessary measure to support the Red Army in its fight against the counter-revolutionary forces, but it also alienated many sections of the population, especially the peasants, who constituted 80% of the Russian population. The peasants resisted the requisitioning of their produce by hiding or destroying it, reducing their output, or engaging in armed rebellion. As a result, agricultural production declined sharply, leading to widespread famine and disease. Industrial production also suffered from a lack of raw materials, fuel, transport and labour. By 1921, industrial output was only 14% of its pre-war level. The economic collapse was accompanied by social unrest and political instability. In March 1921, a mutiny broke out among the sailors at Kronstadt naval base, who demanded political reforms and an end to war communism. The mutiny was brutally suppressed by Trotsky's Red Army, but it shook the confidence of the Bolshevik leadership and convinced Lenin that a change of policy was necessary.

The NEP was announced by Lenin at the 10th Congress of the Communist Party in March 1921 as a "strategic retreat" from war communism. The NEP aimed to restore some elements of market economy and private enterprise, while maintaining the socialist direction of the state. The main features of the NEP were: the replacement of grain requisitioning by a tax in kind, which allowed peasants to sell their surplus on the market; the legalisation of private trade and small-scale industry; the introduction of a stable currency and a fiscal system; the encouragement of foreign investment and trade; and the relaxation of political censorship and repression. The NEP was intended to be a temporary measure to revive production and consumption, create incentives for workers and peasants, improve living standards, and win over popular support for the regime. The NEP also reflected Lenin's recognition of the diversity and complexity of Soviet society, which could not be reduced to a simple dichotomy between proletariat and bourgeoisie. Lenin acknowledged that there were different classes and groups in Soviet society, such as peasants, artisans, traders, intellectuals, etc., who had different interests and needs, and who could not be forced into a single mould of socialism. Lenin called these groups "non-proletarian allies" or "fellow travellers", who could be tolerated or even co-opted by the regime as long as they did not challenge its authority or goals.

The NEP achieved some positive results in terms of economic recovery and social stability. Agricultural production increased from 37.6 million tons of grain in 1921 to 72.5 million tons in 1926, surpassing the pre-war level. Industrial production also grew from 12.1 billion rubles in 1921 to 19.7 billion rubles in 1926, reaching 40% of its pre-war level. Trade and commerce flourished, both domestically and internationally. The Soviet Union established diplomatic and economic relations with many countries, including Germany, Britain, France, Turkey and China. The NEP also improved the living conditions and morale of the population. The famine and disease that had killed millions of people in 1921-22 were overcome by 1923. The rationing system was abolished and consumer goods became more available and affordable. The cultural and intellectual life of the country also revived, as artists, writers, scientists and educators enjoyed more freedom and creativity. The NEP era was marked by a diversity and dynamism of cultural expression, ranging from avant-garde movements such as constructivism and futurism to traditional forms such as folk art and literature.

However, the NEP also faced many challenges and criticisms, both from within and outside the party. The NEP created a new category of people called NEPmen (нэпманы), who were traders, speculators, profiteers and middlemen who exploited the market opportunities and accumulated wealth at the expense of the workers and peasants. The NEPmen were seen by many communists as a threat to the socialist ideals and values of the revolution, as they represented a revival of capitalism and class inequality. The NEP also widened the gap between the urban and rural areas, as well as between different regions of the country. The industrial sector lagged behind the agricultural sector, creating a shortage of manufactured goods and a surplus of agricultural products. This led to a decline in the prices of agricultural products and a rise in the prices of industrial goods, resulting in a "scissors crisis" that hurt the peasants' income and purchasing power. Moreover, some regions of the country, such as Ukraine, Georgia and Central Asia, benefited more from the NEP than others, such as Siberia and the Far East, creating regional disparities and tensions. The NEP also exposed the Soviet Union to external influences and pressures, as foreign capital and culture penetrated the country. Some communists feared that the NEP would undermine the sovereignty and security of the Soviet state, as well as its ideological purity and identity.

The NEP also provoked debates and divisions within the Communist Party over the direction and pace of socialist construction. Lenin died in 1924, leaving behind a power struggle among his successors. The main contenders were Stalin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev and Bukharin. Stalin emerged as the leader of the party by 1927, after defeating his rivals through a combination of political manoeuvres, ideological arguments and repressive measures. Stalin advocated a radical departure from the NEP, arguing that it had fulfilled its purpose and outlived its usefulness. Stalin claimed that the NEP had created a "dual economy" that was unstable and unsustainable, as it contained both socialist and capitalist elements that were incompatible with each other. Stalin also argued that the NEP had created a "dual society" that was divided and hostile, as it contained both proletarian and bourgeois classes that were antagonistic to each other. Stalin proposed to replace the NEP with a campaign of rapid industrialisation and collectivisation, which he presented as the only way to achieve socialism in one country, to catch up with the advanced capitalist countries, and to prepare for an inevitable war with them.

Stalin's campaign of industrialisation was launched in 1928 with the first Five-Year Plan (1928-1932), which set ambitious targets for increasing production in various sectors of industry, such as coal, iron, steel, oil, electricity, machinery, etc. The plan was based on a centralised command economy system that mobilised all available resources for industrial development. The state controlled all aspects of production planning,
allocation and distribution of resources, setting of prices and wages, and collection of taxes and profits. The state also imposed strict discipline and targets on the workers, and punished any deviations or failures with fines, dismissals, arrests or executions. The state also mobilised the masses for industrialisation through propaganda, education, and mass organisations, such as trade unions, youth leagues, women's associations, etc. The state also encouraged the development of a new elite of managers, engineers, technicians and experts, who were rewarded with privileges and incentives for their contribution to industrialisation.

Stalin's campaign of collectivisation was launched in 1929 with the aim of eliminating private ownership of land and creating large-scale collective farms (kolkhozes) or state farms (sovkhozes) that would be more efficient and productive. The collectivisation was also intended to break the resistance of the peasants to the regime and to extract more grain from them to feed the urban population and to export it for obtaining foreign currency. The collectivisation was carried out by force, using violence, terror and coercion. Millions of peasants were deported, exiled, arrested or executed as "kulaks" (rich peasants) or "counter-revolutionaries". Millions more died from famine, disease or exhaustion. The collectivisation also had negative effects on agricultural production, as it destroyed the traditional peasant culture, reduced the incentives for work and innovation, and disrupted the natural balance of the environment.

The impact of Stalin's policies on Ukraine was particularly devastating, as Ukraine was one of the most fertile and productive regions of the Soviet Union. Ukraine had a long history and culture of its own, which was distinct from Russia's. Ukraine had also experienced a brief period of independence after the 1917 revolution, before being incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1922. During the NEP era, Ukraine enjoyed some degree of autonomy and cultural revival, as it developed its own language, literature, art and education. However, Stalin viewed Ukraine as a potential threat to his power and to the unity of the Soviet state. He sought to suppress any signs of Ukrainian nationalism or separatism, and to assimilate Ukraine into a homogeneous Soviet culture. Stalin also exploited Ukraine's resources for his industrialisation plans, without regard for its welfare or interests.

Stalin's collectivisation campaign hit Ukraine especially hard, as it targeted its main source of wealth and identity: its agriculture. Ukraine was known as the "breadbasket of Europe", as it produced about a quarter of the Soviet Union's grain output. However, Stalin demanded that Ukraine increase its grain deliveries to the state by 44% in 1932, despite the poor harvests and the famine that had already begun in 1931. When Ukraine failed to meet this quota, Stalin accused it of sabotaging his plans and withholding grain from the state. He ordered a series of punitive measures against Ukraine, such as confiscating all its grain reserves, blocking any food aid from outside sources, sealing its borders with other regions, and launching a campaign of terror against its population. These measures resulted in what is known as the Holodomor (Голодомор), or the "Great Famine" of 1932-33, which killed an estimated 3.9 million people in Ukraine alone.

The Holodomor was not only a humanitarian disaster but also a political genocide. Stalin deliberately used famine as a weapon to destroy the Ukrainian people's will to resist his regime and to erase their national identity and culture. He banned any expression or manifestation of Ukrainian language, literature, art or religion. He purged thousands of Ukrainian intellectuals, artists, writers, teachers and clergy who could have been potential leaders or spokesmen for their nation. He replaced them with loyal Russians or Soviet officials who imposed his policies and ideology on Ukraine. He also tried to alter the demographic composition of Ukraine by resettling Russians or other ethnic groups into its territory.

Conclusion

The NEP and Stalin's industrialisation and collectivisation policies had profound effects on the Soviet economy and society in general, and on Ukraine in particular. The NEP was a pragmatic policy that aimed to restore economic recovery and social stability after the civil war and war communism. The NEP allowed some degree of market relations and private enterprise while maintaining state control over key sectors of industry and trade. The NEP achieved some positive results in terms of increasing production and consumption levels improving living standards and reviving cultural and intellectual life. However, the NEP also faced many challenges and criticisms, as it created a new class of NEPmen who profited from the market, widened the gap between urban and rural areas and different regions, and exposed the Soviet Union to external influences and pressures. The NEP also provoked debates and divisions within the Communist Party over the direction and pace of socialist construction.

Stalin's industrialisation and collectivisation policies were a radical departure from the NEP, as they aimed to transform the Soviet Union into a modern industrial power, capable of competing with the capitalist countries and defending itself from external threats. Stalin's policies were based on a centralised command economy system that mobilised all available resources for industrial development and agricultural collectivisation. Stalin's policies achieved some impressive results in terms of increasing industrial output and creating a new elite of managers, engineers and experts. However, Stalin's policies also had devastating consequences for the people and the environment, especially in Ukraine, where millions of peasants were forced to join collective farms, deprived of their land and livestock, and subjected to famine, repression and terror. Stalin also tried to suppress any signs of Ukrainian nationalism or separatism, and to assimilate Ukraine into a homogeneous Soviet culture.

The NEP and Stalin's policies had a lasting impact on the history, culture and identity of Ukraine. The NEP era was a time of relative autonomy and cultural revival for Ukraine, while Stalin's era was a time of genocide and assimilation. The NEP and Stalin's policies also shaped the attitudes and perceptions of Ukrainians towards the Soviet regime and their own nationhood. The NEP and Stalin's policies are still relevant today, as they influence the debates and conflicts over Ukraine's political and economic orientation, its relations with Russia and the West, and its cultural and linguistic diversity.
