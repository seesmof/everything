- [ ] Add a form on load that will show some navigation and maybe program info
- [ ] Add three forms for the three sections and change the form based on button click on sidebar
- [ ] in the usage help page implement a search bar which will dynamically update the different options or sections on that page to better help the user navigate the program

- on the market form for each page we would not create a separate form, because it just won't make sense. instead we will be dynamically changing the contents of the main panel to show or hide some listings
