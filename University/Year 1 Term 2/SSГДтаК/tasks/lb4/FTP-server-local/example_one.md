# Introduction to Web Development

Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves several technologies and tools that allow developers to create interactive and dynamic websites. In this markdown document, we will cover some of the fundamental aspects of web development.

## HTML

[[HTML]] or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages. [[HTML]] is used to structure content on the web and provide [[meaning]] to the web pages. [[HTML]] tags are used to define the elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and so on.

Here's an example of an [[HTML]] code snippet that displays a heading and a paragraph:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## [[CSS]]

[[CSS]] or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a web page. [[CSS]] is used to define the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page. [[CSS]] can be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

Here's an example of a [[CSS]] code snippet that sets the background color and font size of the body element:

```css
body {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

## [[JavaScript]]

[[JavaScript]] is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It is used to add behavior to web pages, such as responding to user events, manipulating the content of a web page, and communicating with servers. [[JavaScript]] can be used to create complex web applications, such as online games, social networks, and e-commerce websites.

Here's an example of a [[JavaScript]] code snippet that displays a message when a button is clicked:

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Hello, world!');
});
```

## Web Development Frameworks

Web development frameworks are collections of libraries, tools, and best practices that help developers build web applications faster and more efficiently. Frameworks provide a structure for organizing code, and they often come with pre-built components that can be used to build common features of web applications.

Some popular web development frameworks include:

- [[React]]: A [[JavaScript]] library for building user interfaces.
- Angular: A [[TypeScript]]-based [[framework]] for building web applications.
- Vue.js: A progressive [[framework]] for building user interfaces.
- Ruby on Rails: A web application [[framework]] written in Ruby.
- Django: A web [[framework]] written in Python.

## Conclusion
