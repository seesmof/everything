    the web cam looks kind of weird zoomed in like that
    
    the week of science starts at the beginning of april (–∫–≤—ñ—Ç–µ–Ω—å) 
    
    conference proceeding —Ç–µ–∑–∏ –¥–æ–ø–æ–≤—ñ–¥—ñ –Ω–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü—ñ—ó
    
    topic related to certain innovations
    
    im wondering how many people will choose AI lol
    
    so, briefly, they proposed to make a presentation for a week of science 
    
    ### Key Points for a successful presentation
    
    - Keeping presentation simple
    - Sticking to 10-20-30 rule: 10 or fewer slides, present under 20 minutes, use at least 30 point font
    - Asking for feedback
    - Include pictures or other visual aspects, maybe videos
    - Maintaining a structure with clear topic names
    - Maintaining good mood and staying energetic throughout the presentation
    
    Steve Jobs is one of the most effective presenters in the world
    
    ### 7 key techniques to use in a presentation
    
    Single headline that sets the whole theme of a presentation
    
    Make sure the topic is clear
    
    Headline should be memorable and set direction, gives an audience a reason to listen
    
    Always provide an outline
    
    Verbally open and close each section with clear transition
    
    Making it easy for listeners to follow the story
    
    Being passionate, enthusiastic
    
    Being fun and excited about the thing you‚Äôre presenting. If you‚Äôre not passionate about it, why would people be
    
    Make meaningful statistics and numbers
    
    Make presentation easy on the eyes: visual and simple
    
    Painting the picture for audience and not overwhelming them
    
    Treat your presentation like a show
    
    Identify the memorable moment and build up to it
    
    Rehearse, rehearse and rehearse once again
    
    At the end of a presentation add ‚ÄúOne more thing‚Äù and introduce some new product or something else that is cool

    ### Key Points
    
    - keeping only one clear message per slide
    - less is more, use bullet points
    - control audience‚Äôs focus by changing the font and size, adding animation etc
    - using dark theme in your presentation
    - six is the magic number
    
    One message per slide, less is more, dont use long sentences, size and contrast, using dark background with bright text, limit objects at 6 per slide. 
    
    Sources for presentation can be videos, but not more than two out of five
