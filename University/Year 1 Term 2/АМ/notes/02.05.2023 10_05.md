- good morning, greetings, so nice to see you all together
- Ihor did a good job at giving us something to do, he made this quiz, my answers are as follows
- A A C A A
- and he showed the correct answers and all of mine are correct, quite good
- he mentioned vendor lock-in in his presentation and the teacher asked him about it and he just started googling it right there hahah that way funny
- now we have to give feedback, oh boy, i absolutely hate this part, knowing that I would have to give feedback to every person who will be answering, thats kind of scary stuff lol
- so Ihor, well he did quite a good job and disclosed the topic quite well, but mispronounced one or two words, the interaction with audience is top notch, he not only asked a question, but also provided a quiz. visual [[aids]] were provided quite extensively throughout the presentation
- Danylo presented next, well, what can I say, i now have to find a good spot in his presentation and a bad one. a good one must be the presentation iteslf, i really liked the design of it, it showed everything very clearly and without any excessive info or cluttering up the screen too much. The bad part would probably be the conciseness of the presentation, i dint time the presentation, but i felt like it was lacking a [[bit]] of detail, he could've talked about the technology lying under the copilot, what model is it using, and talk more about copilot x. acutally, now that im thinking about it, it doesnt make sense, he probably doesnt know anything else about the copilot x, pretty much like everyone else. hmm, i dunno bruh, i think im really bad at critisizing and generally understanding people
