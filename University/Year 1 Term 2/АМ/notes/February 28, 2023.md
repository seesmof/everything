    Joined the class, asking how are we doing, now asking for a session
    
    Yeah, just general discussion about holidays and session
    
    Stepanov is, as always, sharing his thoughts and saying how easy it was and is for him, what a prick
    
    Over the winter holidays we had a wonderful time with friends, explored some beautiful places throughout our country and beyond, and had an overall fantastic vacation during that time.
    
    Bro, just spoke about our session and holidays, it was not fun, I have talking in front of people
    
    We are going to be acting out a dialogue with Milena and here is how it will look like:

    **Student B**: Hi, I'm having a problem with this program. I can't seem to get it to save my work.
    
    **Student A**: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what actions you've already taken to try and fix the issue?
    
    **Student B**: Well, I tried restarting the program and my computer, but that didn't seem to help.
    
    **Student A**: Okay, go ahead and try checking if there are any updates available for the program. Also, make sure that you have enough disk space available for saving your work.
    
    **Student B**: Alright, I'll give that a try. Thank you for your help.

    Iâ€™m gonna be student B and sheâ€™s gonna be student A
    
    Bro, Iâ€™m so bad at talking to people thats just awful, wow, especially with girls. I just hope I wonâ€™t screw up when telling it.
    
    Wow, that is so awkward being in one room with her and just sitting here tapping my keyboard in silence, that is just not great at all. And seeing what I have become with all that weight and when I smile my cheeks just become tremendously huge, fucking nuts. Alright, enough about that, letâ€™s just set ourselves up for a nice successful dialogue.
    
    She also said she has friends. Well, thats nice, unlike me, fucking fat bastard with almost none connections at all. I should probably do something about it, but I donâ€™t know what exactly. I am so socially awkward, thats insane. Man that is such an awful feeling, god. I absolutely hate these social activities!
    
    I fucking hate English classes like that, man. And now weâ€™re gonna have a high math after that as well, wow, what a fucked up day, dude
    
    Home: unit 13, 15 - 
    
    We have an exam on English this term what the FUCK dude
