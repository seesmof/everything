- Just entered the conference and they are asking about the conference proceedings
- Should create and attach a separate file with links to references
- Prosthesis :: протез, prosthetic arm
- Today we are gonna discuss different kinds of bionics and prosthetic limbs
- They gave us a book about something, that is based on TED Talks, which is cool. TED Talks are speaking shows where some people talk about scientific stuff or something like that. Preparation for TED talks take about 4 months, not sure why we need that info. Well, maybe we will do our TED Talk one day ourselves.
- Rehearse :: репетирувати, повторювати, практикувати

### Working on a question “****What problems do you think amputees might face in everyday life?” - Room 3****

[Problems the people with disabilities face - Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1d_0fMWYp9t5djbUSx4eH0SW0ddMZCYjmOPg1z_z-zZU/viewer?pli=1)

- Mobility and dexterity: Lower-limb amputees may experience reduced mobility and difficulty walking or standing for long periods of time. After sufficient care and rehabilitation, they may be able to make use of a prosthetic limb
- Pain and discomfort: Amputees may experience pain in the stump, which is felt on the remaining portion of the injured limb when a group of nerves at the site of the amputation are damaged
- Psychological and emotional reactions: Amputation not only affects function and sensation but also affects body image and social and psychological well-being. Psychological reactions vary greatly and depend on many factors and variable. In most cases, the predominant experience of the amputee is one of loss: not only the obvious loss of the limb but also resulting losses in function, self-image, career, and relationships. Many of the psychological reactions may be transient, some are helpful and constructive, others less so, and a few may require further action
- Employment: Amputees may experience difficulty in resuming work or finding new employment, especially if their livelihood was dependent on motor skills that are lost with the amputation. Unemployment is associated with a greater degree of psychological stress and may be a predictor of phantom pain
- Daily activities: Amputees may face difficulty in performing daily activities such as showering or bathing
- Problems with hygiene: Amputees may face problems with hygiene due to the risk of infection at the site of the amputation. Stump and prosthetic hygiene are important and should be emphasized during the rehabilitative process
- Phantom limb syndrome: Phantom limb pain is more common and is experienced by as much as 80% of all amputee victims. They may also risk infection of the area where the limb was cut due to the open wound if the skin breaks down
- Peer acceptance: Peer acceptance beyond the family is critical in the successful adaptation of all amputees and, especially, children and adolescents. There are a number of charities that can provide advice and support for people living with amputations
- What are ramps for disabled people? :: Ramps are inclined surfaces that provide accessibility for people with mobility issues, such as those who use wheelchairs or have difficulty using stairs. Ramps can be made of various materials, including wood, metal, or concrete, and they are often required by law in public buildings to ensure equal access for all individuals.

How could these areas also help with
the problems you discussed?
housing
financial aid
access to information legal changes
transport

Housing: Governments and local councils can provide financial aid to housing associations to help them build and maintain affordable and accessible housing options for amputees. Improving financing for existing homes can also make it easier for amputees to purchase homes that may need repair. Regarding making houses more inclusive: implement systems that make housing more accessible to people with disabilities. For example, homes can be designed with wider doors, lower light switches, and higher electrical outlets. Homes can also be designed with ramps, grab bars, and visual alarms. In addition, technology can be implemented to make homes more accessible to people with disabilities, such as smart home devices that can be controlled by voice commands, apps that can control home appliances, and sensors that can detect falls or monitor health

Financial aid: Governments and local councils can provide financial aid to amputees to help them cover the costs of medical care and prosthetic devices.

Access to information: Governments and local councils can provide resources and information to amputees on available healthcare options, prosthetic devices, and rehabilitation services.

Legal changes: Governments and local councils can work towards improving accessibility laws to ensure that amputees have access to public spaces, transportation, and housing. They can also work towards anti-discrimination laws to ensure that amputees are not discriminated against in employment or other areas.

Transport: Governments and local councils can work towards improving public transportation to make it more accessible to amputees. They can also provide financial aid to amputees to help them purchase accessible vehicles or modify their existing vehicles to make them more accessible.

- What are pressure sores? :: Pressure sores, also known as bedsores, are injuries to the skin and underlying tissue that occur due to prolonged pressure on the skin. They commonly form on bony areas of the body, such as the heels, hips, and tailbone, and can range in severity from [[mild]] reddening of the skin to deep wounds that extend into the muscle and bone. Pressure sores can be prevented by regularly changing positions, maintaining good hygiene, and using special cushions or mattresses to reduce pressure on the skin.
- What is magnetic resonance imaging? :: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to generate detailed images of the body's internal structures. It is used to diagnose and monitor a wide range of medical conditions, including tumors, infections, and neurological disorders. MRI is non-invasive and does not use ionizing radiation, making it a safe imaging option for many patients. During an MRI scan, the patient lies on a table that slides into a large, cylindrical magnet. The magnetic field aligns atomic nuclei in the body, and radio waves are used to create detailed images of the body's internal structures.
- What is prosthesis? :: Prosthesis is an artificial body part that is used to replace a missing one. It can be used to replace limbs, teeth, eyes, and other body parts. Prostheses can be made from a variety of materials, including plastic, metal, and ceramics. They are designed to be as functional and comfortable as possible, and can be customized to fit the individual needs of the user.

### TED Talk Exercise complete sentences. I was in Room 4

1. David Sengeh was a boy during the war. he was 12
2. Many people who had suffered amputation couldn't afford prosthetic limbs.
3. The prosthetic limbs available in Sierra Leone were painful to wear.
4. While he was still doing his PhD., David Sengeh developed a solution to the prosthetic problem.
5. The sockets David Sengeh makes are cheap to produce
6. David Sengeh wants to make functional prostheses for use anywhere.
- What does finite mean? :: Finite means having bounds or limits, having a measurable or definable size.
- What is PhD? :: PhD stands for Doctor of Philosophy. It is a degree that is awarded to individuals who have completed advanced research and study in a particular field of study. The degree is typically awarded by universities and is considered the highest academic degree that can be earned. The requirements for earning a PhD vary depending on the field of study and the institution, but generally involve coursework, independent research, and the completion of a dissertation or thesis.
