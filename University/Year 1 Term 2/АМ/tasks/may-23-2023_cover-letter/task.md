Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the [[frontend|Front End]] Web Developer position advertised on work.ua by your company. As a computer science undergraduate student with a strong passion for web development, I am confident that I possess the necessary skills and knowledge to be a valuable addition to your team.

I have developed several projects during my studies, most of which are fully responsive websites built with [[HTML]], [[CSS]], and [[JavaScript]]. Through these projects, I have gained hands-on experience with various [[frontend|front-end]] technologies such as [[Vite]] and [[TailwindCSS]]. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world projects and contribute to the success of your organization.

Apart from technical skills, I have also developed soft skills such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. In group tasks, I successfully solved a challenging problem by finding a suiting [[algorithm]] for the situation at hand. Additionally, I have improved my communication skills by presenting a lot on different topics to my groupmates, as well as receiving and giving feedback.

I understand the importance of a clean and functional design in web development, and I strive to create websites that are visually appealing and easy to navigate. I am also aware of the importance of writing clean and efficient code to ensure the website's optimal performance.
