## Overview

- Medieval philosophy refers to the philosophy that existed in Western Europe during the Middle Ages, roughly from the 5th century to the 15th century.
- It was heavily influenced by Christian theology and the works of ancient philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle.

## Major Philosophers

- St. Augustine of Hippo: Known for his emphasis on the importance of faith in understanding God and the universe. His works include _Confessions_ and _The City of God_.
- St. Thomas Aquinas: Arguably the most influential philosopher of the Middle Ages. He sought to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology. His major work is _Summa Theologica_.
- William of Ockham: Known for his principle of parsimony, or Occam's Razor, which states that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. His works include _Summa Logicae_ and _Quodlibeta_.

## Themes

- Scholasticism: A method of learning that emphasized dialectical reasoning and the use of logic to reconcile contradictory ideas. It was used to reconcile faith and reason in medieval theology.
- Natural Theology: The study of God and the universe through reason and observation. It was believed that God could be known through His creation.
- Nominalism: The belief that universals (such as "humanity" or "beauty") do not actually exist, but are only names or concepts created by humans.

Here's a table summarizing the major philosophers and their works:

| Philosopher            | Major Works                      |

In medieval philosophy, there were two main scholastic philosophical schools that continued the lines of Plato and Aristotle. These schools were:

1. The Platonists: This school of thought was heavily influenced by Plato's philosophy, particularly his theory of Forms. The Platonists believed that there were transcendent, eternal Forms or Ideas that existed beyond the physical world. They argued that these Forms were the true reality, and that the physical world was merely a shadow or copy of them. The Platonists were influential in the development of Christian theology, as they saw the Forms as a way of explaining the nature of God and the relationship between God and the world.

2. The Aristotelians: This school of thought was based on the philosophy of Aristotle, particularly his emphasis on empirical observation and logical reasoning. The Aristotelians believed that knowledge could only be gained through observation and experience, and that reason was the key to understanding the world. They were instrumental in the development of natural philosophy and science in the Middle Ages, as they applied Aristotelian principles to the study of the natural world.

Both the Platonists and the Aristotelians had a [[profound]] impact on medieval philosophy, and their ideas continue to influence philosophical thought to this day.
