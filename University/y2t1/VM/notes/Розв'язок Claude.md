Okay, here are the steps to solve this differential equation:

1. Group the dx and dy terms on their respective sides:
   (4x+2xy^2)dx = (3x^2y+3y)dy

2. Divide both sides by the coefficients of dy:
   (4x+2xy^2)dx/(3x^2y+3y) = dy

3. Integrate both sides:
   ∫(4x+2xy^2)dx/(3x^2y+3y) = ∫dy

4. Solve the integrals:
   (4/3)x^2 + (2/3)xy^2 + c1 = y + c2

Where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.

Therefore, the general solution to the differential equation is:
(4/3)x^2 + (2/3)xy^2 + c1 = y + c2
