CONTEXT: Task from a test on a course called "Special sections of Calculus" on a section "Series".

TASK:
Find the radius of convergence of the power series $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} \frac{(x-2)^n}{n*3^n}$

HINTS: Feel free to give me some Python code to run in order to help you get the answer because this method was proven to get correct answers in the past. But if you choose to give Python code, first provide your opinion on what the answer is. The code must be used only for checking if you are correct or no.

Output the final number as the answer. The answer must be an integer.
