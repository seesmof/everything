CONTEXT: Task from a test on a course called "Special sections of Calculus" on a section "Differential equations".

TASK:

HINTS: The answer must only be an integer, whereby all the answers I have encountered in the past were from 0 to 6 inclusively. So I think it would be a good idea to try to achieve the final answer in this range give or take. Also, feel free to give me some Python code to run in order to help you get the answer because this method was proven to get correct answers in the past.
