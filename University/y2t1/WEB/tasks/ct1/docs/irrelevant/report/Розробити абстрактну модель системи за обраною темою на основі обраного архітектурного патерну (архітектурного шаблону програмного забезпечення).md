## i have a final project to make on a university discipline called Web technology and web design. this project is not limited in any way, so i can use any technology i want, i just need to document it properly and make a few other formal steps. right now im rewatching our lecture where our teacher tells us about what we need to do. and i stopped it on an item that says: Develop an abstract model of the system on the selected topic based on the selected architectural pattern (software architectural pattern). what does this mean? i remember we had a lecture on architectural patterns and we were talking about some NVC, NVVM or stuff like that but i didnt grasp it then and i dont understand it now. my project topic by the way is a movie catalog, similar to letterbox but simplified and called Flickster. help me figure out the current step and what is required from me

Sure, I'd be happy to help clarify this.

When your teacher mentioned "Develop an abstract model of the system on the selected topic based on the selected architectural pattern", they're asking you to design a high-level blueprint of your application. This blueprint should outline the main components of your system and how they interact with each other.

The architectural pattern you've mentioned (NVC, NVVM) is a design pattern. Design patterns are general solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices and can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

- NVC (N-tier architecture) is a software architectural pattern that separates concerns into different layers (N-tier), such as presentation, business logic, and data access. This separation allows for easier maintenance and scalability.
- NVVM (N-tier architecture) is similar to NVC, but it emphasizes the separation of concerns even further. It's often used in enterprise applications and can be more complex to implement than NVC.

For your movie catalog project (Flickster), you might choose a simpler pattern like NVC. Here's how you could apply it:

1. **Presentation Layer**: This is the user interface of your application. It's what the user interacts with. In your case, this could be a web page where users can browse movies, read reviews, and so on.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: This is where the main functionality of your application resides. It processes user input, interacts with the database, and returns results to the presentation layer. For Flickster, this could include features like searching for movies, rating movies, or adding new movies to the catalog.
3. **Data Access Layer**: This layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It retrieves data from the database and sends it to the business logic layer, and vice versa. For Flickster, this could involve retrieving movie data from the database, updating movie ratings, and so on.

Remember, the goal of this step is to create a high-level design of your system. You don't need to go into the details of how each layer will be implemented. You just need to describe what each layer will do and how they will interact with each other. This will serve as a roadmap for your development process.
