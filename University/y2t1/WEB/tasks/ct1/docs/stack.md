I have this Flickster movies browser/catalog built using NextJS and TailwindCSS and a TMDb API. It has 4 pages - about, genres, movies, home. at home it has sections with popular and trending movies and a search bar. at movies it has a catalog of all the movies with filtering and sorting options as well as pagination. at genres it has a grid of available genres and each one leads to movies with appropriate genre selected. at about it has a brief description of the app, my motivation behind it, some history, and a contact form. The app is deployed on Vercel. it also has a navbar with links to the other pages and a search bar, but on larger screens only. on smaller screens it moves to the bottom and contains only the links. everything seems to be relatively neatly organized into components, pages, separate files, etc. and i can drop you whatever code you need. oh, and also it has a page for each movie, its dynamic so it uses just a template and fills in the data via an API by given id. and so this project is my last project for the discipline called "Web development and design" this semester so i would like you to help me with the report which is massive honestly. are you ready? please just confirm before we continue.
