- Main Page - Trending Movies, Popular Movies, Trending Shows, Popular Shows. A see more button for each of these sections
- Movies Categories - Page for each category with filtering and sorting options
- Shows Categories - Page for each category with filtering and sorting options
- Page for each movie with description, rating, cast, year, and poster
- A search bar, persistent across the app, and a page that will show the search results
- To reduce the amount of work we need to do, lets create one global page for all the movies and TV shows that will allow to sort, filter and search our movies. This is where we'll be redirected from categories page, from the main page and from the search page. We will need to include sorting, filtering based on category, based on the type of media and based on the search (if it was envoced this way)

Your plan for the app sounds solid and well-structured. Here's a quick rundown of the pages and features you've outlined:

1. **Main Page**: This page will showcase trending and popular movies and TV shows. Each section will have a "See More" button to redirect users to the corresponding category page.
2. **Movies Categories Page**: This page will display a list of movie categories, with each category linking to a page showing movies in that category. This page will also have sorting and filtering options.
3. **Shows Categories Page**: Similar to the Movies Categories Page, but for TV shows.
4. **Movie Page**: This page will display detailed information about a specific movie, including a description, rating, cast, year, and poster.
5. **Search Bar**: This search bar will be persistent across the app, allowing users to search for specific movies or TV shows from any page.
6. **Global Page**: This page will display all movies and TV shows, with sorting, filtering, and search functionality. It will serve as a central hub for users to browse and search for content.

This plan provides a clear structure for your application and covers the main features you want to include. It's a good idea to start with the basic structure and then gradually add features and functionality. Good luck with your project!
