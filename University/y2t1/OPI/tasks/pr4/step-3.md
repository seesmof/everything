Continuing from where you left off, the third step in the process of using FAR Manager for advanced file search would be to configure the search parameters.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. After pressing `Alt+F7` to open the search dialog, you'll see a dialog box with various fields for entering search criteria.

2. In the "Search for" field, you can enter the name of the file you're looking for. If you're not sure about the exact name, you can use wildcards (`*`) to represent any number of characters. For example, if you're looking for a `.txt` file, you could enter `*.txt` to find all text files.

3. In the "Search in" field, you can specify the directories where you want to start the search. You can enter multiple directories separated by semicolons (`;`).

4. In the "Search by mask" field, you can specify the file types you're interested in. For example, if you're looking for `.txt` and `.doc` files, you could enter `*.txt;*.doc`.

5. You can also specify other search options in the dialog box, such as searching in subdirectories, searching for files with specific attributes (like read-only or hidden), and more.

6. Once you've entered your search criteria, click the "Search" button to start the search.

7. FAR Manager will display a list of files that match your search criteria. You can navigate this list using the arrow keys and press `Enter` to open a file.

8. If you want to stop the search at any time, you can press `Esc` to close the search dialog.

Here's a simple code snippet that demonstrates how to use FAR Manager's search feature:

```python
# Open FAR Manager
os.system("far.exe")

# Press Alt+F7 to open the search dialog
os.system("Alt+F7")

# Enter search criteria
search_criteria = "*.txt"
os.system(f"echo {search_criteria}")

# Start the search
os.system("Search")
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not work as expected because FAR Manager is a GUI application and cannot be controlled using Python's `os.system()` function. However, it gives you an idea of how to use FAR Manager's search feature programmatically.

For more detailed information about FAR Manager's search feature, you can refer to the official FAR Manager documentation or ask for help on the FAR Manager forum [Source 13](https://documentation.help/Far-Manager/index.html).
