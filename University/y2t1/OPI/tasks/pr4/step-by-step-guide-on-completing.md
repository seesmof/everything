Let's break down the task into smaller parts and tackle them one by one.

## Step 1: Install the File Managers

First, you need to install the three file managers: FAR, Midnight Commander, and Total Commander. The installation process varies depending on your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the `apt` package manager to install these file managers.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mc totalcmd far
```

## Step 2: Learn How Each File Manager Works

Each file manager has its own unique features and user interface. Let's take a closer look at each one:

- **Midnight Commander**: This is a visual file manager that provides a two-panel interface. It supports keyboard shortcuts for file operations such as copy, move, and delete. For example, to delete a file, you highlight the file and press `F8`. To copy files, you can use `F5`.
- **Total Commander**: This is a powerful file manager that supports plugins for compression, file system, and file types. It offers a dual-pane layout for easy file operations. Total Commander also has a powerful file search feature that allows you to use regular expressions to find file names or even inside the content of the files. It can filter by file size, date, and others, or even find duplicate files.
- **FAR Manager**: This is a text-based file manager that encourages keyboard operation. All actions are easily accessible with keyboard shortcuts, and you can quickly record macros for any repeatable action. FAR Manager also supports many plugins and has an offline context help feature.

## Step 3: Explore the Capabilities of the File Managers

Next, you should explore the capabilities of the most common plugins and various options for advanced file and data search. Take screenshots of your findings and document them.

## Step 4: Analyze the Common Features and Differences

Now, you should analyze the common features and differences of these file managers. Summarize your analysis in a table that includes the advantages and disadvantages of each file manager.

## Step 5: Study the Hotkeys

Lastly, study the hotkeys for each file manager and create corresponding reference tables. Identify the keyboard shortcuts that are repeated across all file managers.

Remember, practice makes perfect. The more you use these file managers, the more comfortable you will become with their features and shortcuts.
