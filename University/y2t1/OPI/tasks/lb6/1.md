CONTEXT:
Lab on a university discipline - Fundamentals of Software Engineering. Lab topic - handling of keyboard events.

CURRENT TASK:
Implement the "keyboard trainer" program. The program displays a certain character to be entered and a timer for entering it. Provide for 5 degrees of difficulty - adjusting the allotted time and the number of letters and words to be entered. Also provide a table of the best results with the ability to automatically write and read from a file. In addition, implement the storage and download of user progress;

List a full complete step-by-step instruction on how to fully complete the given task. Do not skip anything and list every step one needs to take in order to complete CURRENT TASK using C# WinForms.
```

---

To complete the given task, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new Windows Forms Application project in Visual Studio using C# as the programming language.
2. Add the following controls to the main form:
   - A Label named `lblCharacter` to display the character to be entered by the user.
   - A TextBox named `txtInput` to allow the user to enter the character.
   - A Label named `lblTimer` to display the remaining time for entering the character.
   - A Button named `btnStart` to start the game.
   - A Button named `btnStop` to stop the game.
   - A ComboBox named `cmbDifficulty` to select the difficulty level of the game.
   - A Label named `lblScore` to display the current score of the user.
   - A Button named `btnBest` to show the best results table.
3. Add a Timer named `tmrGame` to the form and set its `Interval` property to 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
4. Add a class named `Result` to the project with the following properties:
   - `Name` of type `string` to store the name of the user.
   - `Score` of type `int` to store the score of the user.
   - `Difficulty` of type `string` to store the difficulty level of the game.
5. Add a class named `BestResults` to the project with the following properties and methods:
   - `Results` of type `List<Result>` to store the list of best results.
   - `FileName` of type `string` to store the name of the file where the best results are saved.
   - `Load()` of type `void` to load the best results from the file.
   - `Save()` of type `void` to save the best results to the file.
   - `Add(Result result)` of type `void` to add a new result to the list and sort it by score and difficulty.
   - `Show()` of type `void` to show the best results in a message box.
6. Add a global variable of type `BestResults` named `bestResults` to the main form and initialize it with the file name `"bestresults.txt"`.
7. Add the following global variables to the main form:
   - `char character` to store the current character to be entered by the user.
   - `int time` to store the remaining time for entering the character.
   - `int score` to store the current score of the user.
   - `int maxTime` to store the maximum time for entering the character based on the difficulty level.
   - `int minChars` to store the minimum number of characters to be entered based on the difficulty level.
   - `int maxChars` to store the maximum number of characters to be entered based on the difficulty level.
   - `int minWords` to store the minimum number of words to be entered based on the difficulty level.
   - `int maxWords` to store the maximum number of words to be entered based on the difficulty level.
   - `Random random` to store a random number generator object.
8. In the constructor of the main form, add the following code:
   - Call the `Load()` method of the `bestResults` object to load the best results from the file.
   - Add the following items to the `cmbDifficulty` combo box: `"Easy"`, `"Medium"`, `"Hard"`, `"Expert"`, and `"Master"`.
   - Set the `SelectedIndex` property of the `cmbDifficulty` combo box to 0 (Easy).
   - Call the `ResetGame()` method (to be defined later) to reset the game variables and controls.
9. Add a method named `ResetGame()` to the main form with the following code:
   - Set the `character` variable to `\0` (null character).
   - Set the `time` variable to 0.
   - Set the `score` variable to 0.
   - Set the `maxTime`, `minChars`, `maxChars`, `minWords`, and `maxWords` variables according to the `SelectedIndex` property of the `cmbDifficulty` combo box using a switch statement. For example, for Easy difficulty, you can use the following values: `maxTime = 10`, `minChars = 1`, `maxChars = 1`, `minWords = 1`, and `maxWords = 1`.
   - Set the `Text` property of the `lblCharacter` label to `"Press Start to begin"`.
   - Set the `Text` property of the `txtInput` text box to `""` (empty string).
   - Set the `Text` property of the `lblTimer` label to `"Time: 0"`.
   - Set the `Text` property of the `lblScore` label to `"Score: 0"`.
   - Set the `Enabled` property of the `btnStart` button to `true`.
   - Set the `Enabled` property of the `btnStop` button to `false`.
   - Set the `Enabled` property of the `txtInput` text box to `false`.
   - Set the `Enabled` property of the `cmbDifficulty` combo box to `true`.
10. Add a method named `GenerateCharacter()` to the main form with the following code:
    - Declare a local variable of type `int` named `chars` and assign it a random value between `minChars` and `maxChars` using the `random` object.
    - Declare a local variable of type `int` named `words` and assign it a random value between `minWords` and `maxWords` using the `random` object.
    - Declare a local variable of type `string` named `str` and initialize it to `""` (empty string).
    - Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to `words`.
      - Use another for loop to iterate from 1 to `chars`.
        - Declare a local variable of type `char` named `c` and assign it a random character between `'a'` and `'z'` using the `random` object.
        - Append `c` to `str` using the `+=` operator.
      - If the current word is not the last word, append a space (`' '`) to `str` using the `+=` operator.
    - Set the `character` variable to `str`.
    - Set the `Text` property of the `lblCharacter` label to `character`.
11. Add a method named `StartGame()` to the main form with the following code:
    - Set the `Enabled` property of the `btnStart` button to `false`.
    - Set the `Enabled` property of the `btnStop` button to `true`.
    - Set the `Enabled` property of the `txtInput` text box to `true`.
    - Set the `Enabled` property of the `cmbDifficulty` combo box to `false`.
    - Set the `Text` property of the `txtInput` text box to `""` (empty string).
    - Set the `Focus` property of the `txtInput` text box
