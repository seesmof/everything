To convert the provided Python code into a Ukrainian flowchart (ISO 5807-85), you can use the following steps:

1. **Start**: This is represented by a circle. It's the first step of your flowchart.
2. **Input**: This is represented by a parallelogram. It's where you ask the user for a number.
3. **Process**: This is represented by a rectangle. It's where you validate the input.
4. **Decision**: This is represented by a diamond. It's where you check if the number is less than or equal to zero.
5. **Output**: This is represented by a parallelogram. It's where you print an error message if the number is less than or equal to zero.
6. **Loop**: This is represented by a rectangle. It's where you generate a multiplication table for the number up to 10.
7. **Output**: This is represented by a parallelogram. It's where you print the multiplication table.
8. **End**: This is represented by a circle. It's the last step of your flowchart.

Here's a textual representation of the flowchart:

```
Start
 |
 V
Input: Enter a positive integer to generate a multiplication table
 |
 V
Process: Validate the input
 |
 V
Decision: num <= 0
 |    \
 |     V
 |   Output: ERROR: Please enter a positive integer
 |
 V
Output: Multiplication table for {num}
 |
 V
Loop: Generate a multiplication table for the number up to 10
 |
 V
End
```

Please note that the flowchart is a high-level representation of the algorithm. It doesn't include every detail of the Python code, but it gives a general idea of how the algorithm works.

Also, remember that the exact shapes and symbols used in a flowchart can vary depending on the standard or style guide you're following. The ISO 5807-85 standard might have specific symbols and shapes for different types of steps. You should refer to the standard or a reliable guide to ensure you're using the correct symbols.
