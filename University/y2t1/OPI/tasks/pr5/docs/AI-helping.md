**user**: here's the task i need to complete:

- Get acquainted with the basic theoretical information on the topic of work, using the methodological instructions, as well as the recommended literature
- Thoroughly analyze all the software products from the section Brief Theoretical Information
- Among all the software products listed, choose five for yourself
  - Draw.io
  - Lucid Chart
  - Microsoft Visio
  - Gliffy
  - Pencil Project
- Find installer download sites or official user registration sites for the selected toolkits
- Download a free or trial version of the selected programs for the appropriate operating system from these sites, or register an account for online versions
- Install or run each of the five selected software products
- Study all five programs in detail and methodically
- Learn the general principles of operation and unique features of each of the five selected tool environments
- Independently invent a simple, unique and at the same time simple algorithm with input/output blocks, conditional structures and loop elements
- In each of the five selected software products, create a flowchart of the algorithm from the previous paragraph in accordance with the Unified Program Documentation System standard ISO 5807-85. Provide screenshots of these flowcharts for all five selected tool environments in the report.
- Analyze the common features and differences of all five programs. Summarize the analysis of features, similarities, and differences in a single table. Indicate the advantages and disadvantages of each of the five selected tool environments over the others

and here's the algorithm i have:

```python
# Step 1: Ask the user for a number
try:
    print()
    num = int(input("Enter a positive integer to generate a multiplication table: "))
except ValueError:
    print("ERROR: Please enter a valid positive integer.")
else:
    # Step 2: Validate the input
    if num <= 0:
        print("ERROR: Please enter a positive integer.")
    else:
        # Step 3: Generate a multiplication table for the number up to 10
        print(f"\nMultiplication table for {num}:")
        for i in range(1, 9 + 1):
            print(f"{num} * {i} = {num * i}")
        print()
```
