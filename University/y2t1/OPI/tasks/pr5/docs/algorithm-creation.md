Sure, let's create a simple Python algorithm that generates a multiplication table for a given number. This algorithm will use input/output blocks, conditional structures, and loop elements.

Here's the algorithm:

1. Ask the user for a number.
2. Validate the input to ensure it's a positive integer.
3. Generate a multiplication table for the number up to 10.

Here's the Python code implementing the algorithm:

```python
# Step 1: Ask the user for a number
try:
   num = int(input("Enter a positive integer to generate a multiplication table: "))
except ValueError:
   print("ERROR: Please enter a valid positive integer.")
else:
   # Step 2: Validate the input
   if num <= 0:
       print("ERROR: Please enter a positive integer.")
   else:
       # Step 3: Generate a multiplication table for the number up to 10
       print(f"\nMultiplication table for {num}:")
       for i in range(1, 11):
           print(f"{num} * {i} = {num * i}")
```

In this code:

- We first ask the user for a number using the `input` function. We wrap this in a `try`/`except` block to handle any `ValueError` that might occur if the user enters something that can't be converted to an integer.
- If the user enters a valid number, we check if it's a positive integer. If it's not, we print an error message.
- If the number is valid, we generate a multiplication table for it using a `for` loop. We print each row of the table using the `print` function.

This algorithm is simple, unique, and uncomplicated, as requested. It uses input/output blocks to interact with the user, conditional structures to validate the user's input and make decisions, and loop elements to generate the multiplication table.
