so the idea is to have this heap class and for user to be able to interact with it. now the main question is how to do it. well lets read the docs first. so we need to be able to perform

- adding elements - have an input field and some (?) file for storing the data
- deleting an element
- performing a heap sort, quick sort and built-in sort and outputting the results as well as the time taken

so, in summary

- adding, deleting elements
- loading, saving data to and from file
- sorting

for those three we will need a place to output the currently available files, a button to shuffle the elements under that output box, three buttons for sorting and two input boxes with buttons for adding and deleting elements.
