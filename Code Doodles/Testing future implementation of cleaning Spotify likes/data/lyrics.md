A Child's Tale
Bukahara

You've never seen Paris
And you never drank champagne
You've never been to the seaside
For you, it's only clouds and rain

You never went out for dinner
You never slept in a hotel
Your mother always told you
"Son, one day you will marry well"

And so it goes
The old unchanging story
You can change
But you cannot choose where you come from

You never took a plane
You never sat in a new car
These things are not for people
Who seem to come from afar

You never thought you're special
You never had self esteem
And all of your heroes
They are living on your TV screen

And so it goes
The old unchanging story
You can change
But you cannot choose where you come from

Even today, when you're walking
You still look down on the ground
As if you were still searching
For something that you never found

There are so many roads you can walk down
No one knows what you will become
The only thing applying to everyone
Is that we can not choose where you come from, oh-oh

And so (so) it goes (it goes)
The old unchanging story
You can change
But you cannot choose where you come from

Oh, well, so (so) it goes (it goes)
The old unchanging story
You can change
But you cannot choose where you come from
Oh, you cannot choose where you come from
Oh, you cannot choose where you come from
Oh, you cannot choose where you come from
