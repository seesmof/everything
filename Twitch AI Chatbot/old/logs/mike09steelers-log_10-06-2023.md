17:21:01

seesmof: i dont drink bro, thats definitely gonna only worsen things for me

---

17:21:16

seesmof: haha nuh man, its temporary anyway

---

17:21:40

seesmof: it does, but then it turns into an adiction and i dont want no more of those lol

---

17:22:56

seesmof: yea, i dont think i need that, i have enough of stuff that pulls me down anyway lol

---

17:25:23

seesmof: have you seen a 2001: A Space Odyssey?

---

17:26:31

seesmof: a 1968 movie by Kubrick

---

17:26:58

seesmof: the guy is just playing on speakers

---

17:27:44

seesmof: literally, your teammate has their speakers as a sound output source

---

17:27:57

seesmof: i could a bit, it was pretty evident

---

17:28:46

seesmof: most likely, though, just through your headphones. if so, the sound must've been real loud indeed :D

---

17:29:24

seesmof: i think so

---

17:29:32

seesmof: yea, i cannot hear teammates directly

---

17:30:05

seesmof: oh i think i do hear a bit of music

---

17:30:10

seesmof: sometimes

---

17:30:11

seesmof: yea

---

17:30:21

seesmof: yeah

---

17:30:36

seesmof: yep

17:31:09

seesmof: have you, by any chance, seen or heard of an Apple announced device called Vision Pro?

---

17:32:02

seesmof: everybody tracks you

---

17:32:23

seesmof: i aint a big fan either, but the device looks promising and interesting. do you know what augmented reality is?

---

17:34:24

seesmof: yeah, kind of VR, but you can also see the real world

---

17:34:49

seesmof: it just adds stuff, sort of, on top of the virtual world. and the device can also act as a VR headset, which is also cool

---

17:35:45

seesmof: not familiar with the thing you're talking about, but the way you say it seems about right. you can show both the real world and the virtual stuff

17:38:11

seesmof: yea, exactly right. i got what youre talking about. and its that, but right in front of you because those are glasses, look sort of like typical VR, so you wear them right in front of your eyes, so it definitely adds to the immersion

---

17:39:35

seesmof: drunk goggles?

---

17:40:16

nightbot: @BubbaJigglez set up this night bot so if it sucks blame him

---

17:40:36

seesmof: hmm, understood. never seen that before

---

17:42:14

seesmof: yeah, definitely. so those ones are just your typical Apple system, but in AR or VR, so pretty much like a step up from the iPhone or a Mac. might just be the new way we consume content and interact with the virtual world and its kinda scary how many both possibilities and dangers it brings
